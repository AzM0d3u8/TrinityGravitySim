# TrinityGravitySim
 This repository contains a simulation of a three-body gravitational system, where the orbits of three celestial bodies are modeled using Newton's law of gravitation. The simulation calculates and visualizes the motion of the three bodies in three-dimensional space, taking into account their masses, positions, and velocities.  Key Features:  Simulates the motion of three bodies in a gravitationally bound system.  Uses numerical integration (ODE solver) to solve the equations of motion.  Visualizes the orbits of the bodies in 3D space using matplotlib and numpy.  Includes parameters for real-world astronomical objects, such as stars from the Alpha Centauri system.  Provides insights into complex orbital interactions and gravitational dynamics.  This project is a useful tool for visualizing the chaotic dynamics of three-body systems, often studied in astrophysics and celestial mechanics.
